3) Test funcs womp womp
4) HTML setup!!!
5) Login page to get user data into local storage
6) Maps page with links to the quests 
7) Build out the quest pages (render to page, update local storage on submit, redirect back to map)
8) Back on maps page, conditionally render links and check if game is over, if so redirect to results page
9) Design results page
